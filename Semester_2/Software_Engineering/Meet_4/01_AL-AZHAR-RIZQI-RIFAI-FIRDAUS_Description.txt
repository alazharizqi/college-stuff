In a recorded interview with Ms. Amel, she revealed that she wanted a system that could record the data of cars entering her paint shop. After the car is painted, she wants to be able to contact the car owner via WhatsApp and inform him that his car has been painted. In addition, he wanted to know the type of paint and materials used to paint the car, so that he could calculate the total cost incurred for each car that was painted. The aim was to estimate the price of painting for cars of the same type. In the interview, he mentioned that he still finds it difficult to estimate painting costs accurately. He hopes that the system will help him keep track of the income and expenses at his car paint shop.
