Traditional methodology waterfall

in general sdlc models can be categorized into two
- traditional
- agile

relative effort for phases
phases between feasibility study and testing
- known as development phases.
among all life cycle phases
- maintanance phases consumes maximum effort
among development phases
- testing consumes the maximum effort

characteristic
most organizations usually define:
- standards on the deliverable produced at the end of every phase
- entry exit criteria for every phase.

they also prescribe specific methodologies for:
- specification
- design
- testing
- projact management

main goal of feasibility study: determine wheter developing the product is 
- financially worthwhile
- technically feasible

first roughly understand what the customer wants
- different data which would be input to the system
- processing needed on these data
- output data to be produced by the system
- various constraints ont the behaviour of the system

work out an overall understanding of the problem
formulate solution strategies
examine alternate solution strategies
- resources required
- cost of development and
- development time

perform a cost/benefit analysis to determine which solution is the best

we may determine that none of the solutions is feasible due to:
- high cost
- resource constraints
- technical reasons

aim of this phases
- understand the exact requirements of the customer
- document them properly

consist of two disctinct activities
- requirements gathering and analysis
- requirements spesification

requirements gathering and analysis
main goal to collect all related data from the customer

how to gather the requirements 
- usually collected from the end users through interviews and discussions
- for example for a business accounting software
	- interview all the accountants of the organization to find out their requirements.

how to do requirements analysis?
- analyze the collected data to clearly understand what the customer wants
- find out any inconsistencies and incompleteness in the requirements
- resolve all inconsistencies and incompleteness
