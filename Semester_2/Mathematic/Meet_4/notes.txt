ordered pair
an ordered pair(x,y) is a single element consisting of a pair of elements in which
= x is the first element(coordinate)
= y is the seccond element(coordinate)
if {a,b} is a set, then {a,b} = {b,a}
if {a,b} is an ordered pair, then (a,b) not equals (b, a)
two ordered pair (x,y) and (w,z) will be equal if x = y and z

Cartesian product

the cartesian product of two sets A and B is the set of all ordered pairs(a,b) with a element of A and b element of B
A X B = {(a,b)|a element of A and b element of B}
A X B not= B X A
|A X B| not= |B| X |A|
example
a, b
(a,b),(b,a)


relations
A relation R from set A to set B is a subset of A x B.
if (a,b) elements R, we say that "a is related to b" and write aRb
if (a,b) not elemetns R, we say that "a is not related" and write aNotRb
if A = B, we often say that R is a relation on A
example
a, b
(a,b) not (b,a) karena hanya dihitung identitas saja.

domain & range
The domain of relation R is the set of all first elements of the ordered pairs which belong to R, denoted by Dom(R)
the range is the set of seccond elemetns of the ordered pairs which belong to R, denoted by Ran(R)
example
A = {1,2,3} and B = {x,y,z}, and consider the relation R = {(1,y), (1,z), (3,y)}
The domain of R is Dom(R) = {1,3}
The range of R is Ran(R) = {y,z}
The codomain of R = {x,y,z}

inverse relations
let r any relation from set a to b. the inverese of r, denoted by r-1 is the relations from b to a denoted by
r-1 = {(b,a)|(a,b) element of r}

composition of relations
suppose a, b, c are sets and
r is a relation from a to b
s is a relation from b to c
then composition of r and s denoted by r little o s, is a relation from a to c defined by
r little s = {(a,c)|reverse E b elements b, for which (a,b) element r and (b,c) element s}

Symetric relations
a relation r on a set a is symetric if whenever (a,b) element r then (b,a) element r. thus r is not symetric if there exists a,b element a such that (a,b) element r but (b,a) not element r.
