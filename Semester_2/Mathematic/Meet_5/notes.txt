definition of function

a relation is a corespondence between a first set, calleed the domain and a seccond set, called the range such that each member of the domain corresponds to at least one member of the range.

functions are special relations

every set of ordered pairs is a relation but every relation is not function

function make up a subset of all relations.

a function is a relationship between two variables such that each value 


functional notation
we have seen fakyu

surjectife
range = codomain

injectife
one to one (pasangannya unik)

bijective
a function is bijective (surjective and injective) if every of the codomain is mapped to by exactly one element of the domain. (that is the function is both injective and surjective)




domain & range of a function

domain of a function
every realation has a domain, the set of input values over which it is defined

composite function


piecewise-defined functions
a piecewise-defined function is a function that is defined by two or more equations over a specified domain.

odd function
simetris terhadap (0,0) / origin

even function
simetris terhadap sumbu y

inverse function
balik x dan y
