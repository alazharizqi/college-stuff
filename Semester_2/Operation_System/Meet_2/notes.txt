Operation System Structures

Operating system provide an environment for execution of programs and services to programs and users.

one set of operating system services provides functions that are helpful to the user.

user interface - almost all os have a user interface (UI)
- varies between = cli, GUI, Batch

program execution - the system must be able to load a program tinro memory and to run that program, end execution, either normally or abnormally (indicating error)

i/o operations - a running program may require i/o which may involve a file an i/o device.

one set of operating system service provides functions that are helpful to the user:

- file system manipulation - the file system is of particular interest programs need to read and write files and direcories, create and delete them, search them, list file information, permission management.
- communications - process may exchange information on the same computer or between computers over a network.
communications may be via shared memory or through mesasge passing (packets moved by the os).
- error detection - os needs to be constanly aware of possible errors
- may occur in the cpu and memory hardware, in i/o devices, in user program.
- for each type of error, os should take the appropiate action to ensure correct and consistent computing.
- debugging facilities can greatly enhange the user's and programmer's abbilites to efficiently use the system.

another set of os functions exists for enduring the efficient operations of the system itself via resource sharing.
- resource allocation - when multiple users or multiple jobs running concurrently, resources must be allocated to each of them.
- many types of resources - cpu cycles, main memory, file storage, i/o devices- accounting - to keep track of which users use how much and what kinds of computers resources.
- protection and security - the owners of informatins stored in a multiuser or networked computer system may want to control use of that information, concurrent process should not interfere with each other.
- protection - involves ensuring that all access to system resources is controlled.
- security - of the system from outsiders requirs user authentication, extend to defending external i/o devices from invalid access attempts.
